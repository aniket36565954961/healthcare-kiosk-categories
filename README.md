# Healthcare Kiosk Categories in India

This repository focuses on creating a structured and scalable **product category framework** for healthcare kiosks deployed across India, with a special focus on accessibility, affordability, and rural/urban healthcare needs.

## üìå Project Objective

To define, organize, and document a comprehensive set of categories and subcategories for healthcare kiosk solutions, which include:

- Diagnostic tools
- Patient monitoring systems
- Telemedicine interfaces
- Pharmacy & medicine dispensing
- Health record integration
- User interfaces for multilingual support
- Kiosk types (urban, rural, mobile, semi-permanent)
